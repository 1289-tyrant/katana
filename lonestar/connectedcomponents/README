Connected Components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all connected components of an undirected (symmetric) graph. Set the same label
to nodes which belong to the same component.
Two major categories of algorithm: Pointer Jumping and Label Propogation.
Pointer Jumping is based on union-find that nodes' label is a pointer pointing to its
representative. Representative are updated when two trees are connected and merged 
into one tree. The program keep executing until no pointer can be updated.
In Label Propagation, the label is set to node ID initially. Each node keeps checking 
if its neighbors' label is smalled than its. If yes, update its label to neighbor's label. 
Keep doing until no node can be updated.

serial: Serial pointer-jumping implementation.
synchronous: Bulk synchronous data-driven implementation. Alternatively execute on two 
worklists.
async: asynchronous topology-driven implementation. Work unit is a node.
blockedasync: asynchronous topology-driven implementation with NUMA-aware optimization.
Work unit is a node.
edgeasync: asynchronous topology-driven. Work unit is an edge.
edgetiledasync (default): asynchronous topology-driven. Work unit is an edge tile.
labelProp: Label propagation implementation.

Pass in a symmetric .sgr graph.

BUILD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run cmake at BUILD directory (refer to top-level README for cmake instructions).

2. Run `cd <BUILD>/lonestar/connectedcomponents; make -j`

RUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run default algorithm (edgetiledasync), use the following:
./connectedcomponents <input-graph (symmetric)> -t=<num-threads>

To run a specific algorithm, use the following:
./connectedcomponents <input-graph (symmetric)> -t=<num-threads> -algo=<algorithm>


TUNING PERFORMANCE  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default algorithm 'edgetiledasync' works best on rmat25, r4-2e26, roadUSA graphs.
Two parameters 'EDGE_TILE_SIZE' and 'CHUNK_SIZE' (granularity of work stealing) are 
crucial to performance and has to be tuned on different platforms. They are set to 
be 512 and 1 respectively by default.
