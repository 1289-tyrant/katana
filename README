==== Online Documentation ====
See online documentation at:
 http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois/doc/current/getting_started


==== Basic Compiling ====
We use cmake. Run the following commands to set up a basic build configuration:

  ROOT=`pwd`
  (mkdir -p build/default; cd build/default; cmake ${ROOT})

or

  (mkdir -p build/debug; cd build/debug; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ${ROOT})

More esoteric systems may require a toolchain file, check ../cmake/Toolchain
if there is a file corresponding to your system. If so, use the following
cmake command:

  cmake -C ${ROOT}/cmake/Toolchain/${platform}-tryrunresults.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${ROOT}/cmake/Toolchain/${platform}.cmake ${ROOT}


==== Basic Use ====
You can run the sample applications and make your own Galois programs directly
in the build tree without installing anything. Just add a subdirectory under
apps and copy a CMakeLists.txt file from another application.


==== Installing ====
If you want to install Galois as a library,

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${installdir} ${ROOT}
  make install

or, to speed up compilation,

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${installdir} -DSKIP_COMPILE_APPS=1 ${ROOT}
  make install


==== Using Installed Galois ===
If you are using CMake, put something like the following CMakeLists.txt:
  set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ${installdir}/lib/cmake/Galois ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH})
  find_package(Galois REQUIRED)
  include_directories(${Galois_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${Galois_CXX_COMPILER})
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS  "${Galois_CXX_FLAGS} ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}")
  add_executable(app ...)
  target_link_libraries(app ${Galois_LIBRARIES})

Using basic commands (although the specific commands vary by system):
  c++ -std=c++11 app.cpp -I${installdir}/include -L${installdir}/lib -lgalois
